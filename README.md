## Blue Notes

Blue Notes helps you search your notes by meaning, not just by words.
It connects ideas, finds patterns you might have missed, and makes your notes feel more alive and connected.

All semantic search happens locally on your computer, keeping your data safe and offline.
The optional AI chat feature uses your own API key and connects to the internet only when you choose to use it.

## Features

- üîç **Semantic Search** ‚Äì Find notes by meaning, not just keywords
- üîí **Private & Offline** ‚Äì Searching happens on your computer, no data leaves your device
- üîó **Connected Thinking** ‚Äì Discover related ideas automatically across your vault
- üí¨ **AI Chat (Optional)** ‚Äì Ask questions about your notes using your own API key
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Single Dependency** ‚Äì Powered only by ONNX Runtime

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Installation & Setup
1. Open Obsidian Settings ‚Üí Community Plugins ‚Üí Browse
2. Install **"Blue Notes"** and enable it

The plugin automatically:
- Downloads ONNX Runtime binaries (~50-127MB depending on your platform)
- Downloads an AI embedding model
- Indexes your vault in the background
- Notifies you when ready

**First-time setup takes a few minutes.** The plugin downloads ONNX Runtime (the engine that powers local AI) and a small AI model to enable private, offline semantic search. After this one-time setup, everything runs locally on your device.

### Step 2: Start Searching
1. Open **Command Palette** (`Cmd/Ctrl + P`)
2. Run "**Semantic search**"
3. Type what you're looking for (by meaning, not exact words)

**Example:** Searching for "*happiness research*" will find notes about "*well-being studies*", "*positive psychology*", and "*life satisfaction*", even if those specific words aren't in your search.

### Step 3: Choose Your Model (Optional)

You can customize which AI model to use for semantic search.
Different models offer trade-offs between speed, language support, and accuracy.

Open Settings ‚Üí Blue Notes ‚Üí Model selection to choose one of the following:

- **all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (default)** - Small, fast, English-only model with solid performance
- **Nomic-Embed-Text v1.5** -	Multilingual model supporting 70+ languages

## How to Use

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Semantic search** | Find notes by meaning across your entire vault |
| **Find related notes** | Show notes semantically related to your current file |
| **Process entire vault** | Index all notes (run once at setup, or after major changes) |
| **Process current file** | Update the index for just the current note |


### Optional: AI Chat
Want to ask questions about your notes?

1. Click the chat icon in the ribbon (or use Command Palette ‚Üí "**Open AI chat**")
2. Add an **API key** in settings (e.g. OpenAI)
3. Select which notes to include as context
4. Ask questions like:
   - *"What are my main ideas about love?"*
   - *"Summarize everything I've written about postmodern philosophy"*
   - *"What connections exist between my work notes and personal goals?"*

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Chat requires an internet connection and only sends the notes you explicitly select. Search remains fully private and offline.

## Privacy: What Happens to Your Notes?

### Local Semantic Search (Always Private)

- ‚úÖ Runs 100% on your computer
- ‚úÖ Works offline after initial setup
- ‚úÖ Your notes **never leave your device**
- ‚úÖ No tracking or data collection

**One-time download:** When you first use the plugin, it downloads ONNX Runtime binaries (~50-127MB depending on your platform) and a ~90MB AI model from HuggingFace. After that, everything is local.

### AI Chat (Optional Feature)

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Only works when you choose to use it
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires internet connection
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Only sends **notes you manually select** as context
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Uses **your own API key** (you control the provider)

**You're always in control.** The chat feature is completely optional and clearly separated from private search.

## Where Files Are Stored

Blue Notes stores all files within your vault:

```
.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-sense/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/              # AI embedding models
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cache/               # Search index
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ onnxruntime-node/    # ONNX Runtime binaries (auto-downloaded)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ data.json            # User settings
```

All data stays local and can be safely deleted anytime.

## Platform Support

Blue Notes supports the following platforms:
- macOS (Intel x64 & Apple Silicon arm64)
- Windows (x64)
- Linux (x64 & arm64)

ONNX Runtime binaries are automatically downloaded based on your platform when you first enable the plugin.

## FAQ

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **Is this really private?** | Yes. Semantic search runs 100% locally. AI chat only sends notes you explicitly choose, and only if you enable it. |
| **Do I need an API key?** | No. Semantic search works without any API key. You only need one for the optional chat feature. |
| **Does it work offline?** | Semantic search works offline. AI Chat needs internet. |
| **Does it work on mobile?** | No, desktop-only. |
| **Will it slow down Obsidian?** | Only during initial processing. After that, searches are very fast. |

## Troubleshooting

**ONNX Runtime installation failed**
- Check your internet connection
- Open Settings ‚Üí Blue Notes ‚Üí ONNX Runtime Status
